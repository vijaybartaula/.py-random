This Python script provides a simple command-line interface for converting units of length, weight, and temperature. The user can select the type of conversion they want to perform and input the values accordingly.

Components of the Code
1. Length Converter Function (length_converter):
Purpose: Converts values between different length units.
Parameters:
value: The numeric value to convert.
from_unit: The unit to convert from (e.g., meters, kilometers).
to_unit: The unit to convert to.
Implementation: A dictionary (length_units) defines conversion factors for various length units relative to meters.

2. Weight Converter Function (weight_converter):
Purpose: Converts values between different weight units.
Parameters:
value: The numeric value to convert.
from_unit: The unit to convert from (e.g., kilograms, grams).
to_unit: The unit to convert to.
Implementation: Similar to the length converter, it uses a dictionary (weight_units) for weight conversion factors and performs the conversion if the units are valid.

3. Temperature Converter Function (temperature_converter):
Purpose: Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
Parameters:
value: The numeric temperature to convert.
from_unit: The unit to convert from (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit).
to_unit: The unit to convert to.
Implementation: This function includes conditional statements to handle the different formulas required for temperature conversions, as they do not follow a single ratio like length and weight units.

4. Main Function (unit_converter):
Purpose: Acts as the user interface for the program.
Flow:
It prompts the user to choose a type of conversion (length, weight, or temperature).
Depending on the user's choice, it asks for the value and the units to convert from and to.
It calls the appropriate converter function based on the user's input and prints the result.
If an invalid choice or unit is entered, it returns an error message.

5. Execution:
The script includes a check (if __name__ == "__main__":) to ensure that the unit_converter function runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.

Usage
When the user runs the script, they will see a menu to select the type of conversion.
After entering the required values and units, the script will display the converted result.
